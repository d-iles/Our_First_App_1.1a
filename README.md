# Productivity_App_1.2a


Hello world! This is a collaborative project between Daniel Iles and David Garcia. We are developing a productivity app that will organize the input tasks in order of priority. We are using Android Studio (primarily with Java) to create our app. The SDK we are using is (Version 30.0.2). Please let us know of any suggestions you may have on how we can improve our code!
